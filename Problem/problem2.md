Problem: Free-Electron Band Structure and Effect of Lattice Periodicity

Recall the derivation of the Bloch eigenvalue equation
H_k u_k = E_k u_k discussed in class. Consider a one-dimensional crystalline system in which the amplitude of the periodic potential is slowly reduced to zero, while the lattice periodicity is kept intact.

Q1.
Assume a lattice with periodicity a. In the free-electron limit, take the periodic part of the Bloch function as

u_m(x) = exp(i 2πm x / a),

where m is an integer.

Using this form, calculate and plot the energy dispersion

E_k = (ħ² / 2m_e) (k + G_m)²,

where G_m = 2πm / a, for wave vectors in the range

k = −6π/a to +6π/a.

Identify how the integer m corresponds to the band index and describe the resulting band structure.

Q2.
Now consider a lattice with doubled periodicity 2a.

Repeat the calculation and plot the energy dispersion for the same range of k. Compare the resulting band structure with that obtained in Q1, and explain the effect of changing the lattice periodicity on the Brillouin zone and band folding.

Objective:
To understand the origin of electronic energy bands in the free-electron limit and to study how changing the lattice periodicity affects the band structure through Brillouin-zone folding.
