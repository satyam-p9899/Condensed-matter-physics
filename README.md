# Condensed-matter-physics
This repository contains numerical solutions and computational implementations of problems in Condensed Matter Physics. The primary focus is on solving theoretical physics problems using numerical methods and computational modeling.

The codes in this repository are designed to:

Translate analytical physics problems into numerical algorithms

Study physical systems where closed-form solutions are difficult or impossible

Test, validate, and visualize theoretical predictions through computation

The repository emphasizes:

Clear and well-documented code

Physical interpretation of numerical results

Reproducibility and methodological transparency

This repository is intended for students and researchers interested in applying numerical techniques to problems in condensed matter physics and related areas.
